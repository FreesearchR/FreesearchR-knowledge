This will contain a basic introduction to data science and data analysis as a foundation for starting to use the FreesearchR app.\nKey motivations for this project are to\n\nlower the barrier to do data analysis\nempower clinicians to perform data analysis on own data locally\nprovide learners with basic knowledge to make informed decisions\n\nThe main audience for this project is clinicians, researchers and students with a need for basic analytical tools and knowledge to start interpreting clinical data. The methods used are general and can be used beyond this main audience.\nThis knowledge database will mainly consist of instructions and descriptions for the FreesearchR app as well as a collection of links and references for recommended further reading and learning.",

You have three options available for importing data: file upload, REDCap server export and local or sample data.\nAfter choosing a data source nad importing data, you can preview the basic data structure and missing observations, set a threshold to filter data by completeness and further manually specify variables to include for analyses.\n\n3.2.1 File upload\nSeveral data file formats are supported for easy import (csv, txt, xls(x), ods, rds, dta). If importing workbooks (xls(x) or ods), you are prompted to specify sheet(s) to import. If choosing multiple sheets, these are automatically merged by common variable(s), so please make sure that key/ID variables are correctly named identically.\n\n\n3.2.2 REDCap server export\nExport data directly from a REDCap server. You need to first generate an API-token (see these instruction) in REDCap. Make sure you have the necessary rights to do so.\nPlease don’t store the API-key on your device unless encrypted or in a keyring, as this may compromise data safety. Log in to your REDCap server and retrieve the token when needed.\nType the correct web address of your REDCap server.\nThe module will validate the information and you can click “Connect”.\nThis will unfold options to preview your data dictionary (the main database metadata), choose fields/variables to download as well as filtering options.\n\n\n3.2.3 Local or sample data\nWhen opening the online hosted app, you can load some sample data to try out the app. When running the app locally from R on your own computer, you will find all data frames loaded in your environment here. This extends the possible uses of this app to allow for quick and easy data insights and code generation.",

For this exercise, just include all variables.\n\n\n7.1.3 Baseline characteristics\nSee “Baseline characteristics” on how to create a baseline characteristics table.\n\n\n7.1.4 Plotting\nNow on to the plotting. I will start by showing how to visualise the overlapping features of hypertension, diabetes and living alone:\n\nOpen the “Visuals” panel,\nselect “hypertension” as the “Response variable” to see plotting options, and\nselect “Euler diagram” and\nselect “diabetes” and “cohabitation” as “Additional variables”,\nclick “Plot”.\n\n\n7.1.4.1 Creating categorical variables\nIf you want to create new dichotomous (2-level categorical) variables from continuous data, then follow the below steps (as an exaple the “mfi_6” variable will be used):\n\nGo to “Prepare” -&gt; “Edit and create data”, the\nselect “New factor” (factor is the technical term for a categorical variable), and then\nin the pop-up window, under “Variable to cut”, select “mfi_6”,\nkeep the “Method” “fixed”, and choose “2” under “Number of breaks” to create a categorical variable with 2 levels.\nSelect the cut-off between the two levels to 12 for the “mfi_6” variable, and then\nclick “Create factor variable”.\n\nA new variable called “mfi_6_cut” is now created. Repeat the above steps for other variables you want to cut.\n\n\n7.1.4.2 (Re)ordering categorical variables\nSome scoring systems are designed to have a higher score correspond to worse outcome and others are opposite. To specify the order of the categorical levels and allow for correct plotting with the Euler plot (the plots the first level), follow these steps:\n\nWhile in the same panel (“Prepare” -&gt; “Edit and create data”), click the “Reorder factor levels”, and\norder the levels with the first level at the top (drag in the small 3x3 dot grid to the left of the level names), and then\nclick “Update factor variable”\n\n\n\n\n7.1.5 Now its time for experimentation\n\nTry create categorical variables from the age variable to create a baseline table grouped by age below or above 70.\nCreate an Euler diagram of age (below/above 70), cohabitation and male sex.\nCreate and Euler diagram of MFI, MDI (cut-off at 20) and WHO (cut-off at 17). Please note the the WHO should range from 0-100, but the included variable is scaled down by a factor of 4 and ranges 0-25.\n…\n\n\n\n\n\nDamsbo, Andreas Gammelgaard, Kristian Lundsgaard Kraglund, Henriette Nørmølle Buttenschøn, Søren Paaske Johnsen, Grethe Andersen, and Janne Kaergaard Mortensen. 2020. “Predictors for Wellbeing and Characteristics of Mental Health After Stroke.” Journal of Affective Disorders 264 (March): 358–64. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2019.12.032.",
