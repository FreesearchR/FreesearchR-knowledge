This will contain a basic introduction to data science and data analysis as a foundation for starting to use the FreesearchR app.\nKey motivations for this project are to\n\nlower the barrier to do data analysis\nempower clinicians to perform data analysis on own data locally\nprovide learners with basic knowledge to make informed decisions\n\nThe main audience for this project is clinicians, researchers and students with a need for basic analytical tools and knowledge to start interpreting clinical data. The methods used are general and can be used beyond this main audience.\nThis knowledge database will mainly consist of instructions and descriptions for the FreesearchR app as well as a collection of links and references for recommended further reading and learning.",

These data are published for educational purposes in the “stRoke” package, which also includes a few tools for clinical stroke trials.(Damsbo 2023)\nThe TALOS trial was a randomised trial, with a predefined analysis plan and a published protocol.(K. Kraglund et al. 2015) As the trial was randomised, the main analyses where",

    "text": "2.1.1 Load the data\nStart of by launching the FreesearchR app (click this link).\n\nGo to the “Get started” tab,\nunder “Choose your data source”, select “Local or sample data”,\nthen under “Select data source”, select “stRoke”, and\nthen under “Select a dataset”, select “trial”.\n\nThis should load the data, and you can press the “Quick overview” to preview the data classes and missing values.\nIn the section “Select variables for final import”, you can decide to set a missingness threshold and specify variables to initially include. Leaves these options at the default for now. For this exercise, just include all variables.\n\n\n2.1.2 Baseline characteristics\nHaving loaded the relevant dataset, we will go straight to generating a classic table for overview of the variables, typically what is included in papers as a Table 1.\n\nClick the “Evaluate” panel and\nselect the “Characteristics” sub-panel in the dropdown.\n\nThis is the section, where the characteristics panel is generated.\nIn the sidebar\n\nUnder “Select variable to stratify baseline”, select “active” to stratify by active trial treatment, and\nthen click “Evaluate”, wait a second and have a look at the table generated.\n\nThe table can be exported in a document format.\n\nGo to the “Download” panel at the top,\nunder “Report”, choose the desired document format (MS Word or LibreOffice), and\nclick “Download report”.\n\nThis will generate the report and it will get downloaded to your device. Find it in your downloads folder.\n\n\n2.1.3 Visualise the classic outcome\nThe modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score has been used as the main outcome for a large number stroke trials.(“Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Acute Ischemic Stroke” 1995; Berkhemer et al. 2015; Blauenfeldt et al. 2023) The TALOS trial also used the mRS, but did not include a graph to show the distribution. Let’s create that graph now then:\n\nGo to “Visuals”, and\nselect “mrs_6” as the “Response variable” to see plotting options, and\nselect “Stacked horizontal bars” and\nselect “active” as the secondary variable to stratify by trial treatment, then\nclick “Plot” to view the results.\n\nTo export the plot\n\nClick the “Download” sidebar section to unfold the download options,\nspecify the details and select file format, and\nclick “Download”.\n\nOpen the plot locally to verify the results.\n\n\n2.1.4 Now its time for experimentation\nThe above instructions are intended to introduce some of the functionality of the FreesearchR app. Please review the sections to experiment to explore the functions, but also to explore the data you are using. Here are some questions to think about:\n\nWhat is the median age for men? And for women?\nHow is the distribution of of mRS score at 1 month?\nHow is the distribution of mRS score at 6 months grouped by sex?\nIn the trial introducing IVT treatment(“Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Acute Ischemic Stroke” 1995), several outcome scales were used and binned. How would this be done with the FreesearchR app?\n…\n\n\n\n\n\nBerkhemer, Olvert A., Puck S. S. Fransen, Debbie Beumer, Lucie A. van den Berg, Hester F. Lingsma, Albert J. Yoo, Wouter J.

    "text": "3.1.1 The Euler plot\nThe Euler plot is an area-accurate plot of overlapping features. This can be used to visualise how patients suffer from several diseases or how symptoms of mental health are overlapping.\nPlotting the Euler plot is based on dichotomised categorical variables (2 levels). In the FreesearchR app, categorical variables can be created from continuous data.\n\n\n3.1.2 Load the data\nStart of by launching the FreesearchR app (click this link).\n\nGo to the “Get started” tab,\nunder “Choose your data source”, select “Local or sample data”,\nthen under “Select data source”, select “stRoke”, and\nthen under “Select a dataset”, select “trial”.\n\nThis should load the data, and you can press the “Quick overview” to preview the data classes and missing values.\nIn the section “Select variables for final import”, you can decide to set a missingness threshold and specify variables to initially include. Leaves these options at the default for now. For this exercise, just include all variables.\n\n\n3.1.3 Baseline characteristics\nSee ?sec-trial_baseline on how to create a baseline characteristics table.\n\n\n3.1.4 Plotting\nNow on to the plotting. I will start by showing how to visualise the overlapping features of hypertension, diabetes and living alone:\n\nOpen the “Visuals” panel,\nselect “hypertension” as the “Response variable” to see plotting options, and\nselect “Euler diagram” and\nselect “diabetes” and “cohabitation” as “Additional variables”,\nclick “Plot”.\n\n\n3.1.4.1 Creating categorical variables\nIf you want to create new dichotomous (2-level categorical) variables from continuous data, then follow the below steps (as an exaple the “mfi_6” variable will be used):\n\nGo to “Prepare” -&gt; “Edit and create data”, the\nselect “New factor” (factor is the technical term for a categorical variable), and then\nin the pop-up window, under “Variable to cut”, select “mfi_6”,\nkeep the “Method” “fixed”, and choose “2” under “Number of breaks” to create a categorical variable with 2 levels.\nSelect the cut-off between the two levels to 12 for the “mfi_6” variable, and then\nclick “Create factor variable”.\n\nA new variable called “mfi_6_cut” is now created. Repeat the above steps for other variables you want to cut.\n\n\n3.1.4.2 (Re)ordering categorical variables\nSome scoring systems are designed to have a higher score correspond to worse outcome and others are opposite. To specify the order of the categorical levels and allow for correct plotting with the Euler plot (the plots the first level), follow these steps:\n\nWhile in the same panel (“Prepare” -&gt; “Edit and create data”), click the “Reorder factor levels”, and\norder the levels with the first level at the top (drag in the small 3x3 dot grid to the left of the level names), and then\nclick “Update factor variable”\n\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Now its time for experimentation\n\nTry create categorical variables from the age variable to create a baseline table grouped by age below or above 70.\nCreate an Euler diagram of age (below/above 70), cohabitation and male sex.\nCreate and Euler diagram of MFI, MDI (cut-off at 20) and WHO (cut-off at 17). Please note the the WHO should range from 0-100, but the included variable is scaled down by a factor of 4 and ranges 0-25.\n…\n\n\n\n\n\nDamsbo, Andreas Gammelgaard, Kristian Lundsgaard Kraglund, Henriette Nørmølle Buttenschøn, Søren Paaske Johnsen, Grethe Andersen, and Janne Kaergaard Mortensen. 2020. “Predictors for Wellbeing and Characteristics of Mental Health After Stroke.” Journal of Affective Disorders 264 (March): 358–64. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2019.12.032.",
