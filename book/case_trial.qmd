## A clinical trial on neuroprotection in stroke

This case study will be based on the study "Neuroregeneration and Vascular Protection by Citalopram in Acute Ischemic Stroke (TALOS)".[@kraglund2018]

We will not be able to include all data from this trial, but key tables and figures based on anonymised data from the trial included in the ***FreesearchR*** app will be used.
