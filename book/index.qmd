# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book will form the knowledge data base that goes with the FreesearchR project. This will contain a basic introduction to data science and data analysis as a foundation for starting to use the [FreesearchR app](app.freesearchr.org).

Key motivations for this project are to

- lower the barrier to do data analysis

- empower clinicians to perform data analysis on own data locally

- provide learners with basic knowledge to make informed decisions

The main audience for this project is clinicians, researchers and students with a need for basic analytical tools and knowledge to start interpreting clinical data. The methods used are general and can be used beyond this main audience.

This knowledge database will mainly consist of instructions and descriptions for the [FreesearchR app](app.freesearchr.org) as well as a collection of links and references for recommended further reading and learning.
